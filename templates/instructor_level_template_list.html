    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>As stated in <a href="http://infoforfaculty.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"  class="alert-link">Information for Faculty</a>: “It is essential that instructors set out carefully in writing
            and at the outset of a course or course assignment the extent of permissible student collaboration
            in the preparation of papers, computer programs, or examinations. Students must assume that collaboration
            in the completion of assignments is permitted unless explicitly prohibited by the instructor. Students
            should be reminded that they are expected to acknowledge any collaboration and its extent in all
            submitted work.”</li>
        <li>Reviewing the the <a href="http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Honor Code website</a> may be of assistance as you determine your policy,
            particularly the sections on the <a href="http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/affirmation" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Affirmation</a> and <a href="http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/teaching-integrity" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Teaching With Integrity</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>To prepare an academic integrity policy for this class, choose 1 of the templates provided below and edit as appropriate. Also provided is an option to
            write your own policy from scratch.</strong></li>
